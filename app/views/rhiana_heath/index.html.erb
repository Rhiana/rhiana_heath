	<p>This is a site I made to post my projects and write about my experiences as I learn to code. As well as consolidate the skills I have learned though the <a href="http://teamtreehouse.com/about">Treehouse</a> website. I have am also studying the text <a href = "http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-9.html#%_chap_1">Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs.</a> In addition I am studying Univeristy courses through <a href = "https://www.coursera.org/user/i/b66d5e80aac32d5514923490c0778715">Coursera</a> in formal logic, machine learning and statistics though plan to study more in the future.</p>
	<p> The <a href="about.html">about</a> section gives a little more detail into my history and why I have taken on this project. <a href="projects.html">Projects</a> will store links or examples of my current and past programming projects. My <a href="blog.html">blog</a> will keep a record of my learning progress. Feel free to <a href="contact.html">contact me</a> if you have any queries and I will endevour to answer them.</p>
	<p>This site is hosted at <a href="http://heath.cc/"> heath.cc</a> which also hosts the website of my husband Daniel.
